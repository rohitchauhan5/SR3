Description: The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem,
  which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions
  of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false
  positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast
  algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and
  (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total 
  variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants.
