Description: The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem,
which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions
of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false
positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast
algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and
(3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total
variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants.
